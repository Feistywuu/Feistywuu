Heya, I'm Feistywuushu, mostly contained is a few ideas that I thought were cool - gave them some thought and start coding them.

I've worked with python for nearly 2 years (on-off). Gotten to the point where I'm comfortable with the programming process as a whole and thus I've studied examples from C++,C, 
javascript. 

Currently I'm working on understanding the lower-level intricacies of programming: compilers, computer architecture, TCP/IP suite (OSI-model, contents of a ipv4 packet header); 
some of these flow quite naturally with learning langauges such as C++ - compilation, allocation of memory and different between stack/heap - and others have come through solving
problems on projects.

Working on a Screenscraper Autosell bot GUI, I used: multiprocessing, computer vision; working on a server/client model for UDP data transfer I flirted with using a Man-in-the-Middle
for spoofing IP's to test the threading part of my code (which also required knowledge of C to read/use the winpcap library, til I stubbornly accepted the use of a higher-level 
library (scapy) abstracting lots of the practical things; aswell as learning the format of packets; their headers;the datagram frames they are encapsulated in; and the OSI model 
to provide a basis to understand networkin; so I like to understand and explore the lower-level basis things are implemented from.
