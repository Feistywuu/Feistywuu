Heya, I'm Feistywuushu, mostly contained is a few ideas that I thought were cool; gave them some thought and started coding them.

I've been programming for 2 years~ (on-off), most experience with python. Gotten to the point where I'm comfortable with the programming process as a whole and I've used some C# in unity and learned C++ so I can study how python libraries abtracted away lower level things in their implementation.

Currently I'm working on understanding the lower-level intricacies of programming: compilers, computer architecture, TCP/IP suite (OSI-model, contents of a ipv4 packet header); 
some of these flow quite naturally with learning langauges such as C++ - compilation, allocation of memory and different between stack/heap - and others have come through solving
problems on projects.

I do love the fact you can nonchalantly think of a problem, then just start musing the vague requirements of how to implement a solution... with some effort, research and determination, you just solve each of the smaller sub-problems until voila!

Working on a Screenscraper Autosell bot GUI, I used: multiprocessing, computer vision; working on a server/client model for UDP data transfer I played around with scapy trying to spoof ip's, then eventually I created just created my own packet class and sent the data over the network with some cool I/O streams piping the data straight to the destination I wanted - which was a ffmpeg command which created a rtmp server transmit my video data.
